# Airbnb listings EDA
Project Description:
This project focuses on performing an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of Airbnb listings within a selected city. The goal is to examine various factors such as price, availability, location, and property type to uncover the underlying trends and patterns that influence the demand for Airbnb listings. Through this analysis, we aim to provide a comprehensive overview of the Airbnb market in the city, helping stakeholders to make informed decisions.

Objectives:
- Analyze key factors that influence the demand for Airbnb listings in the city, including but not limited to price, availability, location, and property type.
- Perform thorough data cleaning to prepare the dataset for in-depth analysis, ensuring the removal of outliers and handling of missing values.
- Utilize advanced data visualization techniques to illustrate trends and patterns in the data, making it easier to identify key insights.
- Conduct statistical analysis to substantiate the findings and insights derived from the data.
- Employ Python and Jupyter Notebook as the primary tools for conducting the analysis and visualization, leveraging libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

Criteria:
- The data must be efficiently cleaned to remove inaccuracies and prepare it for analysis. This includes handling missing values, removing outliers, and ensuring the data is consistent.
- The analysis should thoroughly examine the impact of various factors like price, availability, location, and property type on the demand for Airbnb listings. If the review file is chosen, the analysis should adapt to focus on relevant fields.
- Data visualizations should be developed to clearly depict the trends and patterns identified in the analysis. These visualizations should be insightful, making it easy to grasp the dynamics of the Airbnb market in the city.
- Statistical analysis is required to validate the trends and patterns observed, providing a solid foundation for the conclusions drawn from the data.
- The findings should be clearly explained, and a business plan should be suggested based on the insights gained from the analysis.
- Any CSV file from http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data/ can be chosen for this analysis. It is essential that the chosen dataset is up-to-date and relevant to ensure the analysis reflects the current state of the Airbnb market in the selected city.
